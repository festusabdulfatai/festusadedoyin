    <p class="lead">Last updated: 21 January 2026</p>

    <p>This privacy notice explains how personal data is processed in relation to the personal website of <strong>Dr Festus Adedoyin</strong> (the "Site"). The Site is maintained for academic and professional purposes and is primarily informational. This policy aims to be concise, transparent and accessible.</p>

    <h2>Data Controller</h2>
    <p>The data controller for the Site is Dr Festus Adedoyin. For queries about this policy or data-handling practices, contact: <a href="mailto:festusabdulfatai@gmail.com">festusabdulfatai@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact form submissions</strong> — name, email address and message content only when you voluntarily submit the contact form. The form is processed via a third-party provider (Formspree).</li>
      <li><strong>Technical data</strong> — server logs may record limited technical information such as IP address, browser type, device and timestamps when visiting the Site. These are used for security and troubleshooting and are not linked to other personal data unless required for a legal purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Third‑party profile links</strong> — links to services such as ORCID, Google Scholar, GitHub, ResearchGate; clicking those links will take you to third‑party sites governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal basis for processing</h2>
    <p>Processing is based on the legitimate interests of providing an academic profile and enabling professional contact. When you submit contact details, processing is performed on the basis of your consent to communicate with the Site owner.</p>

    <h2>How we use your data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To respond to enquiries sent via the contact form.</li>
      <li>To maintain and secure the Site (including investigating abuse or technical incidents).</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations if required (for example, to respond to lawful requests from authorities).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third‑party processors</h2>
    <p>The Site uses the following third‑party services. Please consult their privacy pages for details:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Formspree</strong> — contact form processing (data: name, email, message). Data transmitted to Formspree is handled according to their policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Fonts</strong> — used to deliver typefaces. Google may log requests to fonts.gstatic.com; see Google's policies for details.</li>
      <li>Other links to publisher websites, ORCID and scholarly platforms are external; those sites control their own processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
    <p>The Site does not employ invasive analytics by default. Minimal technical cookies may be set by the browser for site navigation. If analytic or tracking scripts are added in the future, this page will be updated with clear details and opt-out information.</p>

    <h2>How long we keep data</h2>
    <p>Contact form submissions are retained only as long as needed to respond and for a short administrative period (typically no longer than 2 years) unless a longer retention is required by law. Server logs are retained temporarily for security and diagnostics and are anonymised or deleted regularly.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Request access to personal data held about you.</li>
      <li>Request rectification of inaccurate data.</li>
      <li>Request erasure of data (where lawful and there is no overriding legitimate interest for retention).</li>
      <li>Request restriction of processing or object to processing based on legitimate interests.</li>
      <li>Request data portability where applicable.</li>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Reasonable technical and organisational measures are in place to protect data against unauthorised access, accidental loss or disclosure. However, no online service can be guaranteed completely secure.</p>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
