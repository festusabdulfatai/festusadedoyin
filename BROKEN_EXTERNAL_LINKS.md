Broken external links discovered by `scripts/link_check.py` (2026-01-21)

Summary
- Several DOI links and third-party profile URLs returned non-200 responses when checked from this environment.
- Recommendations are provided per-URL so you can approve automated edits or request manual replacement.

How I tested
- Ran `python3 scripts/link_check.py` which performs HEAD/GET checks for external links.

Problematic URLs and recommended actions

1) DOIs returning 403 (Access denied / paywall / blocking)
- https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.2774  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2023.2189321  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.1080/13547860.2025.2563990  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.1080/15567249.2024.2422521  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2024.2349161  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.1080/19407963.2022.2142235  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcs.70151  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.1145/3652037.3663915  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.1177/00472875211053658  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.1177/0958305X231177740  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.3390/cleantechnol5020026  -> 403
- https://doi.org/10.3390/en15207464  -> 403

Recommended action: Replace DOI links (if possible) with publisher landing pages (journal article page or CrossRef metadata page). If a publisher page is paywalled, add a secondary archived fallback using the Wayback Machine, for example:
https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.2774

I can automatically insert an archive fallback next to each affected link (HTML: add a small "(archived)" link pointing to the Wayback search URL). Confirm and I'll apply.


2) DOIs returning 429 (Too many requests / rate-limited)
- https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-6684-7207-1 -> 429
- https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-6684-7207-1.ch015 -> 429
- https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-6684-9018-1 -> 429
- https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-6684-9018-1.ch010 -> 429
- https://doi.org/10.4018/979-8-3693-1198-1.ch006 -> 429

Recommended action: 429 often indicates temporary rate-limiting. Options:
- Leave as-is and re-check later (no content change).
- Add an archival fallback link (Wayback search) next to the DOI link.


3) DOIs returning 404 (Not found)
- https://doi.org/10.4018/9798369311981 -> 404

Recommended action: Verify the DOI is correct. If incorrect, update to the correct DOI or remove the link. If the DOI is obsolete, add a text note "DOI not resolvable" or link to the publisher/book page.


4) Other external URLs returning non-200
- https://fonts.googleapis.com  -> 404 (root; note: specific font CSS endpoints used on pages return 200)
- https://fonts.gstatic.com -> 404 (root)
  Recommendation: no change required—specific CSS endpoints are fine; the root URLs are not used by pages directly.

- https://github.com/festusadedoyin -> 404
  Recommendation: remove or update this GitHub link (username may differ). Consider linking to the correct GitHub profile or remove the icon/link.

- https://www.igi-global.com/publish/call-for-papers/call-details/9621 -> 429
- https://www.igi-global.com/publish/call-for-papers/call-details/9641 -> 429
  Recommendation: 429 = rate-limited; leave as-is or add archive fallback. These are the `Call for Papers` links included in `research.html` — they are external submission pages; adding an archived fallback is optional.

- https://www.linkedin.com/in/festus-adedoyin-phd-064b5047/ -> 405 (method not allowed; likely due to HEAD request)
  Recommendation: Keep the link; some servers block HEAD requests which produce 405 in automated checkers. No visible user impact in browsers.

- https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Festus-Adedoyin -> 403
  Recommendation: Leave if you want the link public; 403 may be caused by ResearchGate’s blocking of non-browser agents. Consider linking to an alternative profile (Google Scholar or staff profile) if access is important.


Suggested next steps (pick one):
A) Add archival fallbacks for all problematic DOIs and IGI links (safe, reversible). I will append a small `(archived)` link next to each affected external link in the relevant HTML files (e.g., `publications.html`, `research.html`).

B) Replace DOIs with publisher landing pages where known (requires manual verification per DOI). I can do this for a small set if you tell me which ones to prioritise.

C) Remove or update broken personal profile links (GitHub/ResearchGate). I can replace GitHub with a link to the staff profile or remove it entirely.

D) Do nothing now; re-run checks later (429 may resolve).

What do you want me to do? Reply with choices (A/B/C/D) and any specifics (e.g., "apply A and update GitHub link to https://github.com/festusabdulfatai").
