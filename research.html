                            <h5>Introduction</h5>
                            <p>Artificial intelligence is rapidly moving beyond static analytics and decision-support systems towards autonomous and semi-autonomous “AI agents” capable of sensing, reasoning, acting, and learning within complex organisational environments. As governments, multilateral institutions, and regulated industries pursue large-scale digital transformation, AI agents are increasingly embedded in operational workflows, public services, financial systems, and organisational decision-making. However, while technical capabilities continue to advance, significant gaps remain in governance, policy alignment, organisational readiness, and responsible deployment. This book responds to these challenges by examining AI agents not merely as technical artefacts, but as socio-technical systems that reshape organisational structures, accountability, and institutional performance. It brings together interdisciplinary perspectives to provide strategic, policy-informed, and human-centred approaches to the design, governance, and application of AI agents in digital transformation initiatives.</p>

                            <h5>Objective</h5>
                            <p>The primary objective of this edited volume is to advance scholarly and applied understanding of how AI agents can be strategically governed and responsibly deployed within organisational and public-sector transformation programmes. The book seeks to bridge fragmented research across computer science, information systems, public policy, and organisational studies by offering integrative frameworks that connect AI agent architectures with governance, ethics, regulation, and institutional capability. It aims to extend current research by moving beyond algorithmic performance to examine organisational impacts, risk management, accountability mechanisms, and policy coherence. Through empirical studies, conceptual models, and applied case examples, the book contributes to the development of evidence-based practices for AI-enabled transformation in complex, regulated environments.</p>

                            <h5>Target Audience</h5>
                            <p>This book is geared towards researchers, policymakers, and senior practitioners working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, digital transformation, and governance. The primary audience includes academics in computer science, information systems, public policy, management, and digital innovation, as well as doctoral and postgraduate students in these fields. Secondary audiences include public-sector leaders, regulators, consultants, development agencies, and professionals in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, energy, and telecommunications who are responsible for designing, overseeing, or implementing AI-enabled transformation initiatives. The book will be particularly valuable to readers seeking strategic, policy-aligned, and organisationally grounded approaches to AI adoption.</p>

                            <h5>Recommended Topics</h5>
                            <p>Conceptual foundations and typologies of AI agents in organisational contexts; Multi-agent systems for public-sector and enterprise transformation; Digital maturity and organisational readiness for AI agent adoption; Governance frameworks for AI agents in regulated environments; Ethical, legal, and accountability challenges in autonomous and semi-autonomous systems; AI agents and decision-making in public administration and policy delivery; Risk management, assurance, and audit of AI-driven systems; Human–AI collaboration and change management in AI-enabled organisations; AI agents in finance, healthcare, energy, and critical infrastructure; AI agents for monitoring, evaluation, and performance management; Regulatory approaches and policy design for AI agents; Data governance, interoperability, and infrastructure for agent-based systems; Responsible and human-centred design of AI agents; Case studies of AI agent deployment in governments and international organisations; Future directions and research agendas for AI agents in digital transformation.</p>

                            <h5>Submission Procedure</h5>
                            <p>Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before February 28, 2026, a chapter proposal of 1,000 to 2,000 words clearly explaining the mission and concerns of his or her proposed chapter. Authors will be notified by March 14, 2026 about the status of their proposals and sent chapter guidelines. Full chapters of a minimum of 10,000 words (word count includes references and related readings) are expected to be submitted by May 23, 2026, and all interested authors must consult the guidelines for manuscript submissions at https://www.igi-global.com/publish/contributor-resources/before-you-write/ prior to submission. All submitted chapters will be reviewed on a double-anonymized review basis. Contributors may also be requested to serve as reviewers for this project.</p>

                            <h5>Introduction</h5>
                            <p>Monitoring, Learning, and Evaluation (MLE) systems are undergoing a profound transformation as public sector institutions grapple with increasing complexity, uncertainty, and accountability demands. Traditional compliance-driven and indicator-heavy approaches to MLE are increasingly insufficient for capturing learning, adaptation, and real-world impact in dynamic development, governance, and service delivery contexts. At the same time, advances in digital technologies, data science, and artificial intelligence offer new opportunities to reimagine how evidence is generated, interpreted, and used in decision-making. This edited volume positions human-centered innovation as a critical lens for advancing MLE in the public sector. It explores how participatory design, ethical AI, adaptive learning systems, and inclusive evaluation practices can strengthen institutional learning, improve policy responsiveness, and enhance trust between governments, development partners, and the communities they serve.</p>

                            <h5>Objective</h5>
                            <p>The primary objective of this book is to advance contemporary thinking and practice in public sector MLE by foregrounding human-centered approaches and emerging digital innovations. The volume seeks to bridge the gap between theory and practice by presenting conceptual frameworks, methodological innovations, and applied case studies that demonstrate how MLE systems can better support learning, adaptation, and accountability.</p>

                            <h5>Submission Procedure</h5>
                            <p>Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before March 7, 2026, a chapter proposal of 1,000 to 2,000 words clearly explaining the mission and concerns of his or her proposed chapter. Authors will be notified by March 21, 2026 about the status of their proposals and sent chapter guidelines. Full chapters of a minimum of 10,000 words are expected to be submitted by June 20, 2026.
